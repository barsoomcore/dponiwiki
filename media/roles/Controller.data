Creating barriers, deploying traps and snares, causing deceptions and distractions, and generally wreaking havoc upon movement and coordination is the controller’s specialty. Sometimes, you want a “controller” that enhances his allies rather than altering the field; for such characters look to the War Leader role.</p><p>This role can represent abjurers, conjurers, illutionists, transmuters, and even enchanters. For no/low-magic settings it can represent specialized grenades, trick arrows, sonic emitter cannons, or any of a dozen other methods for deploying discontent and confusion across a battlefield.</p><p><b>Level:</b> A controller of the indicated level is a good challenge for a party of about four heroes of that level. One-on-one, a controller has a good chance of defeating a single hero, under optimal circumstances.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Controllers are as varied in their skills as they are in their trappings. That said, certain skills are a given. The controller has Level + 3 ranks in Concentration, Knowledge (any two), and one interaction skill. Up to three additional skills may be had as appropriate to the character’s style and trappings (e.g. Handle Animal and Survival for shaman villains).</p><p><b>Feats:</b> Controllers have few actual feats, relying instead upon their special abilities to hamper and manipulate their foes. Most feats are associated with their trappings. These generally have no combat effects.</p><p><b>Battlefield Mastery:</b> Each time the controller gains this, select one of the following abilities. The area of effect for the abilities is a radius of 5 ft per controller level, no more than 300 ft away. Each ability takes a standard action to activate. If it has duration longer than instant, it lasts for maintenance plus 3 rounds. Maintaining masteries takes a free action, just like maintaining powers; each distinct mastery active adds +2 to the Difficulty of any concentration checks required. Each mastery can be used an unlimited number of times; however, no more than four of the same effect should be active at the same time.</p><p>Feel free to modify each mastery in ways appropriate to the trappings. Perhaps a barrier of fire deals damage to anything passing through it, rather than actually stopping it. A smoke cloud of magical darkness can be penetrated by darkvision. A distracting totem of a lust-inducing illusion requires a Will save. Et cetera.<ul><li><em>Bad Ground:</em> The target area becomes almost impassable. The terrain becomes very difficult, reducing movement speed through the area to one-quarter.</li><li><em>Barrier:</em> The controller creates a ‘wall’ that stops most movement and objects. The wall is 5 ft high and (10 ft per level) long. The wall may be arranged in any contiguous fashion. The wall can be broken (Toughness 5 + ½ level) as an object.</li><li><em>Distracting Totem:</em> The controller creates an area that seriously hampers his foes. Each creature in the area must make a Fortitude save or be sickened. Failure by 5 or more causes a nauseated condition. Failure by 10 or more makes the victim helpless. The victims can recover, getting a new save each round outside the effect, with a +1 per previous save.</li><li><em>Entangling Field:</em> Using appropriate trappings (vines, quicksand, webs, electro-nets, etc) the controller makes an area impassable. All characters in the area must make a Reflex save. Characters that fail are entangled. Failure by 5 or more leaves the character bound and helpless. Characters can escape via Escape Artist (Difficulty 15 + level) or by damaging the restraints (Toughness 1 + ¼ level), which are an object. Characters entering the area must also make a Reflex save, as above. Characters only need to save once per entrance.</li><li><em>Fatigue:</em> The controller creates an area that drains the energy from characters. Characters in the target area must make a Fortitude save or become Winded. Failure by 5 causes the character to become Fatigued. Failure by 10 makes the character Exhausted. Failure by 15 or more renders the victim Unconscious. This is an instant effect. Victims can recover from this unnatural fatigue with only a minute of rest. Ten minutes of rest automatically removes all conditions caused by this ability.</li><li><em>Gravity:</em> The controller effectively increases the gravity in an area. Victims must make a Strength check or be slowed. Failure by 5 pushes the victim to the ground, making them prone and slowed. Victims that fail by 10 are prone and must make another check to take any action at all.</li><li><em>Illusion:</em> The controller generates a believable, but false, image in the area. Characters that interact with it may make a Will save to detect its illusory nature. The illusion cannot actually alter the area, though it can be perceived to do so. See the Illusion power for various modifiers and conditions on the will save.</li><li><em>Mass Slick:</em> An area of unstable terrain (ice, minor earthquakes, grease, etc) trips all within. Characters in or entering the area must make a Reflex save or fall prone. Standing characters in the area at the beginning of their turn must also make a save.</li><li><em>Smoke Cloud:</em> The controller can create an area that blocks visual senses. All vision through the area is blocked, blinding characters within the area.</li><li><em>Thunderclap:</em> Using appropriate means, the controller can temporarily blind and deafen foes. Characters in the area must make a Reflex save or be unable to see and hear. Each round the victim makes a Fortitude save to recover, with a +1 per previous fortitude save. This is an instant effect. Victims immune to Fortitude saves recover automatically, on their turn.</li><li><em>Weather</em>: The controller makes the environment itself distracting in the target area. Using appropriate means, the area becomes distracting, forcing a Concentration check (Difficulty 10 + level) from characters attempting any sort of focused activity.</li></ul><p><b>Difficulty:</b> This is the difficulty of any non-damage saving throws required by the controller’s abilities. The controller’s Intelligence has been factored into this number (so if you change the Int, or use another key ability, change the Difficulty). If another check is called for, and no Difficulty is given, then use this column.</p><p><b>Damage:</b> Controllers don’t rely upon their damaging attacks; however, sometimes you just need something to cause damage. This attack has a range increment of 20 feet and goes out to 10 increments. It is generally used to finish targets trapped by other abilities.</p><p><b>Size:</b> Controllers can be any size, though medium is the most common. If applying size changes, do not adjust ability scores, combat bonuses, or toughness.
