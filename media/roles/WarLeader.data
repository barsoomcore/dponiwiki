1|1||2|2|2|Battle Leader 1, Canny Dodge (Charisma)||3|3|2|1|2|1|1|2|Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge, Notice, Ride|<p>The war leader is a field commander, a leader of troops and a commanding presence on any battlefield. Some inspire their followers through praise and leadership while others use threats and fear. The most dangerous tend to be honorable and noble, but the numbers they can bring and their dedication to dominance make them implacable foes and dangerous politicians.</p><p>Don’t confuse a war leader with a villain that simply attracts followers. Though of moderate power on his own, a war leader uses his followers to even the odds against the party. Other villains may use thugs and footsoldiers but the war leader depends upon them.</p><p><b>Level:</b> A war leader of the indicated level is a good challenge for a party of about four heroes of that level. One-on-one, a war leader has a good chance of defeating a single hero, under optimal circumstances.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> War leaders are as varied in their skills as they are in their methods of influence. That said, certain skills are a given. The war leader has Level + 3 ranks in Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (any one), and Ride. The war leader is also keenly aware of the flow of battle, having Level ranks in Notice.</p><p><b>Feats:</b> War leader feats focus on personal combat and an overpowering presence.<ul><li><em>Canny Dodge:</em> The war leader is a powerful presence, and adds his Charisma as a dodge/parry bonus to his Defense. Despite the war leader’s particular trappings, this bonus applies. This does not apply to foes immune to Fear effects.</li><li><em>Swift Intimidate:</em> The war leader can use the Demoralize use of Intimidate once per round as a Free action.</li><li><em>Battle Leader:</em> The war leader has a number of followers (minions), which is as large or as small as the Narrator needs it to be. A guideline is to use followers equal to ½ war leader level + 2. Additionally, each time he gains Battle Leader he chooses another one of the following abilities.<ul><li><em>Awesome Reputation:</em> A tide of victory, a ferocious reputation, or tactical acumen armors his followers. All followers within hearing of the war leader gain a bonus to their dodge/parry defense equal to the war leader’s Charisma. This bonus is lost when dodge defense would be lost.</li><li><em>Devoted Followers:</em> Through his personal charm and carefull y perfected ability to manipulate the weak but ambitious, the war leader has groomed his followers into a fighting force trained to protect him at all costs. Any of the war leader’s allies within 30 feet of him who have fewer Levels than he has can take actions to defend him. Whenever the war leader’s allies with fewer Levels than his own use the aid another standard action to improve his defense or give him a bonus to attacks, they grant a +4 bonus.</li><li><em>Domineering Thug:</em> The war leader is at his best when he fights weak, inferior foes who can’t hope to match his prowess. He gains a +1 bonus to attacks and damage against foes that have fewer Levels than he has. He loses this benefit if he takes a Wounded or worse condition.</li><li><em>Field Commander:</em> Once per round during an ally’s action, a war leader can grant a bonus equal to his Charisma to an ally’s skill check, defense, or saving throw. This all y must be within 30 feet of the war leader.</li><li><em>Frenzied Commander:</em> If the war leader has no followers either remaining or with him, he may use a standard action to make two attacks. These attacks are at the war leader’s full attack bonus, and are rolled separately. If the attacks target the same creature then they damage is combined, as Combined Attacks, or Two-Weapon Fighting.</li><li><em>Fury Breeds Strength:</em> Once per encounter, as a move action, the war leader can fill his allies with rage. This counts as an interaction skill even though no check is required. Subjects gain the benefits and drawbacks of the Rage feat for a number of rounds equal to the war leader’s level. The fatigue from the rage lasts an equal amount of time. Unwilling allies get a Will Save (Difficulty 10 + ½ level + Cha) to resist.</li><li><em>Grunt Wall:</em> If the war leader is adjacent to an ally who has fewer Level than he has, he can use that ally as cover against ranged attacks. As a move action, the war leader chooses an ally as the target of this ability. The war leader gains complete cover against ranged attacks if his chosen ally is the same size or larger than him. This benefit lasts until the start of the war leader’s next action. It also ends if the chosen grunt drops or moves so that she is no longer adjacent to the war leader.	</li><li><em>Guardian Squad:</em> If the war leader stands adjacent to an ally who has fewer Levels than he has, he can use that ally as a shield. As a move action, the war leader chooses a single ally as the target of this ability. When the war leader suffers an attack, treat the ally as if she were the target of the attack. This ability immediately ends if the war leader’s chosen ally drops or moves so that she is no longer adjacent to the war leader.</li><li><em>Lead from the Rear:</em> Once per encounter, the war leader can change his initiative score to 20 + his initiative modifiers if he does nothing this turn but move away from his opponents. The war leader must choose to use this ability at the end of the current round.</li><li><em>Leadership Inspires Greatness:</em> Once per encounter, as a move action, the war leader can give all allies that can see or hear him a +2 bonus to attack and damage.</li><li><em>Legends Inspire Awe:</em> Once per encounter, as a move action, the war leader can overcome foes with his presence. This counts as an interaction skill even though no check is required. The subjects must make a Will Save (Difficulty 10 + ½ level + Cha). Upon failure they are dazed (taking no action, but defending normally) for one round. On each of the following rounds, subjects can make a Will save (with a cumulative +1 bonus for each save) to shake off their awe and act normally.</li><li><em>Legends Inspire Fear:</em> Once per encounter, as a move action, the war leader can overwhelm foes with fear. This counts as an interaction skill even though no check is required. The subjects must make a Will Save (Difficulty 10 + ½ level + Cha). If they fail, they are shaken and suffer a –2 penalty to attack rolls, checks, and saving throws (except Toughness saves). If the save fails by 5 or more, they are panicked and flee from him as quickly as possible.</li><li><em>Signature Strike:</em> Along the path of legend, the war leader learned a signature attack. Up to once per four levels, the war leader can use a full-round action to make his signature attack. As part of this attack, he can move up to half his speed as if using the Move-By Action feat. If the attack hits, it is a critical threat. Additionally, he gets his Charisma as a bonus on the confirmation roll.</li><li><em>Success Breeds Weakness:</em> The war leader can turn the most powerful of heroes into bumbling fools. Once per encounter, as a standard action, the war leader can turn a character’s heroic potential against them. This counts as an interaction skill even though no check is required. The subjects must make a Will Save (Difficulty 10 + ½ level + Cha). Failure causes the target to take a penalty to all attacks and checks until the end of the encounter. The penalty is equal to the target’s Conviction total. This penalty decreases as the character spends Conviction and increases as they regain it.</li><li><em>WAAAGH!:</em> With a thunderous cry, the war leader can drive all his followers into battle. Once per encounter, as a standard action, he may grant all allies that can he can interact with an immediate standard action. This action must be used to make a charge attack. Hesitant allies get a Will Save (Difficulty 10 + ½ level + Cha) to resist the compulsion.</li></ul></li></ul><p><b>Damage:</b> War leaders are warriors of great skill. They have a basic damaging attack that can represent claws, swords, warhammers, magical auras, kung-fu, or just about any other appropriate description.</p><p><b>Toughness:</b> War leaders get a bonus to their toughness based upon level. This can represent just about any mostly-permanent effect, from armor to feats, to natural armor, to protective enchantments.</p><p><b>Size:</b> War leaders can be any size, though medium is the most common. Generally, don’t adjust the war leader’s abilities, toughness, or combat when changing size.</p>
